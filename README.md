# Personalized Blood Pressure Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts systolic and diastolic blood pressure using non-invasive features such as age,weight,height,bmi,heart rate bpm. The model is built using machine learning techniques like Random Forest and XGBoost.

## 🔍 Features

- Predicts systolic and diastolic blood pressure
- Interactive user interface using Streamlit
- Input features: age,weight,height,bmi,heart rate bpm
- Real-time output with interpretation
- Visual display of Systolic Blood Pressure and Diastolic Blood Pressure

## 📊 Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
